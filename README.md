-There is a time limit that will automatically fail the case if you take too long.
-There are only 3 tries to get the answers wrong. (Each wrong answer will take a percentage of time.)
- Will be given a hint system that will say crpted messages that may or may not assist in your case. However, you can only use this option 3 times.(Think of a partner who always get the answers wrong but suprisingly can be correct about one thing occasingly.)
